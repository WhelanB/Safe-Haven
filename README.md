# Safe-Haven
SafeHaven is the AirBnB for natural disasters - developed as part of a group project on Computers and Society using ASP.NET MVC

SafeHaven allows users to register their homes. In the event of a natural disaster, users can mark their homes as available, 
and those in need who have been displaced can request to stay at a residence until after the disaster has taken place. 

Powered by ASP.NET MVC 5, Razor, and Google Maps JS API
